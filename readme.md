    <li> <h4>POINT </li>
</ul>
This project was part of my <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofcode?lang=en">#100DaysOfCode</a>  challenge. during working on this project, I learned so much about building components and user interfaces. 
<ul>
    <li> <h4>ATTENTION </li>
</ul> 
 when I started this project, I had absolutely no experience about react. and all of my focus was on building UI components and I didn't know/care about extra re-rendering and performance optimization. so if you like feel free to send me a PR
